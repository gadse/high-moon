				],
				[
					"Oh, I am so glad you are in town, something horrible has happened.\nI- I know you came here to visit your friend J-Jack, and- and…"
				],
				[
					"Yes, we’ve not seen each other in years. Agnes, your hands are shaking, what is it?"
				],
				[
					"You- You might want to sit down.",

				],
				[
					"Found?"
				],
				[

				],
				[
					"What?!"

					"Sheriff Short found him behind the saloon when he was making his morning round.\nI tried to talk to him already, but he won’t tell me much.",
					"I’m so sorry. I know you were friends for a long time now.\nI- I thought you’d want to hear from someone familiar, so…"
				],
				[

				],
				[
					"Of course."
				],
				[
					"Any hunch on who did it?"
				],
				[
					"I don’t know… I mean, he was a vampire, like you.\nMaybe his d- death had something to do with that?",
					"I’ve wondered before if there is a werewolf in town.\nYou usually don’t get along all too well, do you?"
				],
				[
					"We usually don’t, no."

				[
					"Short’s not a bad Sheriff, I’d wager he has some ideas already, but-"
				],
				[
					"I will find out who did it."
				],
				[
					"I- I don’t know if this is a good idea, you-"
				],
				[
					"Jack saved my life. The least I can do now is find out who ended his."
				],
				[
					"I know I can’t talk you out of this. But… be careful."
				],
				[
					"I will find the bastard who did this and I will bring them to justice."
				],
				[
					"Please just promise me you will make sure you know what you are doing\nbefore you challenge anyone to a duel."
				],
				[
					"I will. But where should I start?"
				],
				[
					"You- You could probably talk to Sheriff Short and ask him if he suspects anyone.",
					"I heard he also has Jack’s c- corpse. Maybe you can find out something useful?",
					"Or maybe ask Elizabeth at the saloon? She always seems to know what’s going on and\nthe- the body was found around there…",
					"Elizabeth is a vampire as well. Maybe she knows something the Sheriff doesn’t?"
				],
				[
					"Thank you, Agnes."
				],
				[
					"Of course. Friends help each other out. I hope you can find out who’s behind all of this.",
					"Just- Just the thought of whoever did this being here\nin town with us, free to do whatever, is horrifying.",
					"I will be over at the Apothecary if you need to talk to me. Good luck and… be careful."
